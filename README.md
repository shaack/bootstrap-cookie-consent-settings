## Usage

### Construct

Initialize the cookie consent framework with the constructor

```js
var cookieSettings = new BootstrapCookieConsentSettings(props)
```

You should configure the framework with the `props` object, at least the properties `privacyPolicyUrl`, `legalNoticeUrl`
and `contentURL`. The default configuration is

```js
this.props = {
    privacyPolicyUrl: undefined, // the URL of your privacy policy page
    legalNoticeUrl: undefined, // the URL of you legal notice page (Impressum)
    contentURL: "/cookie-consent-content", // this folder must contain the language-files in the needed languages (`[lang].js`)
    buttonAgreeClass: "btn btn-primary", // the "Agree to all" buttons class
    buttonDontAgreeClass: "btn btn-link text-decoration-none", // the "I do not agree" buttons class
    buttonSaveClass: "btn btn-secondary", // the "Save selection" buttons class
    autoShowModal: true, // disable autoShowModal on the privacy policy and legal notice pages, to make these pages readable
    alsoUseLocalStorage: true, // if true, the settings are stored in localStorage, too
    postSelectionCallback: undefined, // callback function, called after the user has saved the settings
    lang: navigator.language, // the language, in which the modal is shown
    defaultLang: "en", // default language, if `lang` is not available as translation in `cookie-consent-content`
    categories: ["necessary", "statistics", "marketing", "personalization"], // the categories for selection, must be contained in the language files
    cookieName: "cookie-consent-settings",  // the name of the cookie in which the configuration is stored as JSON
    cookieStorageDays: 365, // the duration the cookie configuration is stored on the client
    modalId: "bootstrapCookieConsentSettingsModal" // the id of the modal dialog element
}
```

### Show dialog

On a new visit the dialog is shown automatically. 

To allow the user a reconfiguration you can show the Dialog again with

```js
cookieSettings.showDialog()
```

### Read the settings in JavaScript

Read all cookie settings with

```js 
cookieSettings.getSettings()
```

It should return some JSON like

```json
{
  "necessary": true,
  "statistics": true,
  "marketing": true,
  "personalization": true
}
```

or `undefined`, before the user has chosen his cookie options.

Read a specific cookie setting with

```js
cookieSettings.getSettings('statistics')
```

for the `statistics` cookie settings. Also returns `undefined`, before the user has chosen his cookie options.

### Read the settings from the backend

You can read the settings with all server languages, you just have to read the cookie `cookie-consent-settings`. 
The content of the cookie is encoded like a http query string. 

``` 
necessary=true&statistics=false&marketing=true&personalization=true
```

#### PHP helper class

I provide a PHP helper class that you can use to read and write the settings from a PHP backend.

It is located in `php/Shaack/BootstrapCookieConsentSettings.php`. 

You can use it as described in the following example.

```PHP
$cookieSettings = new \Shaack\BootstrapCookieConsentSettings();
// read all settings
$allSettings = $cookieSettings->getSettings();
// read a specific setting
$statisticsAllowed = $cookieSettings->getSetting("statistics");
// write a specific setting
$cookieSettings->setSetting("statistics", false);
```

### Internationalization

You find the language files in `./cookie-consent-content`. You can add here language files or modify the existing. If
you add language files please consider a pull request to also add them in this repository. Thanks.
